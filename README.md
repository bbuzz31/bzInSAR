# bzInSAR
End-end InSAR processing with ISCE, FRInGE, and MintPy

This library contains much of the work used for the following manuscripts:

- Localized uplift, widespread subsidence, and implications for sea level rise in the New York City metropolitan area (https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.adi8259)

- Satellite-based vertical land motion for infrastructure monitoring: a prototype roadmap in Greater Houston, Texas (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-01970-8)

- Toward Sustained Monitoring of Subsidence at the Coast Using InSAR and GPS: An Application in Hampton Roads, Virginia  (https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL090013)

The jupyter notebooks showcase how the various scripts are utilized.

**This is extracted from a larger personal python library and is thus not intended to function in isolation at this time.**
